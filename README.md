# Dobble

### Summary
Dobble (also known as Spot It!) is a popular family card game.
It is a simple pattern recognition game where the players try to find matching symbols on two different cards.
For this project, the aim was to make a browser adaption of the game as part of a small team. This is the result. 
We undertook this project with a deadline of 1 week to use for our JavaScript group projects for our studies at CodeClan.
